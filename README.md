**💡 What I Learned**

- Deepened my understanding of React component structuring

- Gained expertise in Tailwind CSS utility classes

- Understood the importance of layout planning and UI spacing

- Learned how to debug layout alignment issues and maintain consistent design

- Improved my ability to build user-centric and aesthetic dashboards

<br> <br>




**❗ Difficulties I Faced**

- Aligning multiple columns (Status, Action) and fixing their misplacement

- Making sure each UI component stayed within its proper layout section (especially sidebar and header)

- Customizing Tailwind to achieve specific colors like 80% brown + 20% black and styled buttons

- Keeping the layout responsive while making borders bold and visually appealing

- Handling JSX syntax errors (like misplaced return statements or improper JSX nesting)
