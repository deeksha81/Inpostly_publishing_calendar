📤 Scheduled Posts Section: Lists content, platform, time, status, and action buttons (Edit/Delete)

➕ Floating New Post and Settings buttons at the bottom

🎨 Custom styling with:

- Dark chocolate and brown UI theme

- Bold dark blue borders for layout separation

- Stylish date calendar

- Clean post management section

- completely responsive

**💡 What I Learned**

- Deepened my understanding of React component structuring

- Gained expertise in Tailwind CSS utility classes

**❗ Difficulties I Faced**

- Making sure each UI component stayed within its proper layout section (especially sidebar and header)

- Customizing Tailwind to achieve specific colors like 80% brown + 20% black and styled buttons

- Keeping the layout responsive while making borders bold and visually appealing
